   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### * The main goal of data anonymization is to protect an individual's privacy. Typically, this is done by removing identifiable information in certain datasets, ultimately making it difficult to track an individual based on their specific data. "

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### * In the Havasupai Tribe case, researchers from ASU conducted a study on the tribe's prevalence of Type 2 diabetes. The researchers got consent to conduct this study and they gathered blood samples, ensuring the tribe that the samples would be used in looking into Type 2 diabetes. With the blood samples, the researchers also looked at genetic markers for other disorders but they did not gain consent to do so. As a result of this breach in consent, the Tribe sued ASU and ASU payed the Tribe $700,000. This situation opens up a discussion surrounding data collection and consent in research and health. "

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### * The pulse oximeter controversy is about racial biases and inequity in health. The pulse oximeter which measures oxygen saturation in blood does not accurately represent blood oxygen levels in Black patients which can result in missing low blood oxygen levels in patients. This is a result of the systems being created using data from light-skinned patients and ultimately highlights the biases in medicine. "

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### * Institutional Review Boards are an ethics committee that monitors research that involves humans. An IRB must approve a study that involves humans before it can begin, specifically looking at consent and protecting patients. The IRB has a lot of responsibility as it ensure research is ethical and treating subjects well, and they have the authority to terminate a study if necessary. "

   "source": [
    "#### * Spreadsheets simply store data where as databases can organize the data and store more complex data about patients, medical history or treatments. In a database this data can be managed where as in a spreadsheet the data is simply just stated. "

    "#### * A conflict of interest in public health research occurs when the entity conducting the data as another interest or motivator that can influence the research in some way. This could be a financial interest, personal or academic and it can influence how the research is conducted which ultimately would be unethial and potentially affect the outcome of the research. "

    "#### * In health data collection, informed consent is both a legal requirement and ethical. Informed consent not only ensures that people are aware of where their data is being stored and agree to collecting their data, but also that individuals are informed enough to make a decision about their participation in a study. With informed consent individuals will be aware of the risks and benefits of a study and who will have access to it. "
